# DiO Controllers

This project uses a Raspberry Pi 3 to send sensor data from an Atlas Scientific Dissolved Oxygen to a remote server. The controller code is written in Python. This setup assumes that you can setup your Raspberry Pi and that you have a basic knowledge of the command line. If you are having trouble getting your Raspberry Pi working, follow the setup instructions in the Raspberry Pi help [documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Hardware you will need:
- [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
- At least 8GB [Micro SD card](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&field-keywords=micro+sd&rh=n%3A172282%2Ck%3Amicro+sd&ajr=0)
- [Micro USB power supply (2.1 A)](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Keten-Charger-Adapter-Android/dp/B01K7EF2XS/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1510630813&sr=1-2-catcorr&keywords=micro+usb+power+cable)
- Monitor and HDMI cable (only needed to setup)
- Keyboard and mouse (only needed to setup)
- Atlas Scientific [Dissolved Oxygen sensor kit](https://www.atlas-scientific.com/product_pages/kits/do_kit.html)
- [Jumper wires (female-to-male)](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dmobile&field-keywords=female+to+male+jumper+wires)
- [USB Wifi adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Edimax-EW-7811Un-150Mbps-Raspberry-Supports/dp/B003MTTJOY)
- [Breadboard](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&field-keywords=breadboard&rh=n%3A172282%2Ck%3Abreadboard)

Flash the latest version of [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) onto the Micro SD card and get your Pi setup by following the [documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/).

### Software Setup

Once your RP3 is running, connect to your wireless network by going to the icon on the top right of your screen and selecting your access point. Once you are connected to the internet you should download the libraries needed to communicate with the sensor and server. Run the following commands in the terminal.
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git-core
$ sudo apt-get install python-dev
$ sudo apt-get install python-serial
$ sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio
```
These commands may take a little time, this would be a good point to get up and get some coffee :coffee:

By default the serial port on the RP3 is disabled so you will need to manually enable it. To do so run the following commands:
```
$ sudo raspi-config
```
Go to advanced options

![Go to Advanced Settings](setup/raspi-config1.PNG "Step 1")

Then select Enable/Disable serial

![Enable login shell over serial port](setup/raspi-config2.PNG "Step 2")

Select Yes

![Select yes](setup/raspi-config3.PNG "Step 3")

Select Ok

![Select Ok](setup/raspi-config4.PNG "Step 4")

Reboot your RP3

![Reboot system](setup/raspi-config5.PNG "Step 5")

The serial port is now ready to be hooked up!
